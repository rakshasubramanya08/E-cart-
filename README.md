# 🛍️ E-cart – Mini Shopping App

A simple and responsive e-commerce frontend built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to view a list of products, adjust quantities, and see dynamic pricing in a shopping cart UI. It's a great demonstration of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic cart logic — all without any backend.

> ✅ This project is based on the tutorial by [ScriptKiddie on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIfYTaQS_NA&list=PLUZkVL-W-8GKrNbvY-XSLRbyKN_iWqqML&index=20&t=2528s)
